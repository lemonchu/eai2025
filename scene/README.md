The provided scripts in this directory relate to the real SO-101 robot setup.

- `robot.py`: Tests loading the SO-101 simulation and the wrist camera setup.
- `front_camera.py`: Defines the front camera parameters within the simulation.
- `calibration.py`: Determines the intrinsic parameters for the real robot's front camera.
- `undistort.py`: Corrects distortion and analyzes images taken by the real robot.
- `distort.py`: Adds distortion to the simulated pinhole camera model.
- `robots/`: Stores joint calibration parameters for mapping between the real robot and the simulation.
- `dummy_eval.py`: Serves as a reference interface for real robot testing.

**These scripts are provided only for context and reference. You are free to choose any algorithms, simulation methods, or platforms for your actual work.**
